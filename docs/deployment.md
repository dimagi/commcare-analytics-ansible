Deployment
==========

This page outlines best practices around using this repository to deploy a production server.
Details on what files need to be created can be found on the [production inventory](/production/) page.

### Choose a location for the control

While it is possible to run the ansible playbooks from anywhere, 
it is recommended to run them *on the server you are setting up*.
This will ensure consistency and also streamline the install process.

These instructions assume a set up where the ansible control and playbooks are run on the server being set up.

### Set up user accounts

First login to the server and create an account for the ansible user to use.
This can be done with the following command, answering the prompts.

```bash
sudo adduser ansible
```

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-analytics-ansible.git
```

### Run the scripts

Follow the steps in the "Run Installation" section of the [production instructions](/production/). 

### Other tasks

Some other things you might want to do on production.

#### Setting up passwordless SSH

Create `.ssh` directory in the user's home and make sure to set the permissions to 755.

```bash
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 755 ~/.ssh
```

Add an `authorized_keys` file and make sure to set permissions to 700.

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```


#### Working with Superset

In order to run any superset native commands (for example `superset db upgrade`)
you must enter the superset environment and *manually run the postactivate script*.

```python
source ~/www/.virtualenvs/superset/bin/activate
source ~/www/.virtualenvs/superset/bin/postactivate
```
